## Background

I have been using RVM for installing and managing ruby.  Recently, I have been hearing about chruby and how it would make my terminal run a bit fast because it is a little less invasive than RVM.  I also like the simplicity of it all.

## 0. Before You Start

Remove current ruby version manager.  If you have RVM like I did, then run:

{% highlight bash %}
rvm implode
{% endhighlight %}

## 1. Ruby-Install
Chruby dosen't handle installing ruby but ruby-install does:

* install ruby-install

{% highlight bash %}
brew install ruby-install
{% endhighlight %}

* install any version of ruby

{% highlight bash %}
ruby-install ruby 2.1.2 # or whatever version you need
{% endhighlight %}

## 2. Setup chruby 

* Install chruby

{% highlight ruby %}
brew install chruby
{% endhighlight %}

* Config terminal by putting the below lines into your .profile or .bashrc file

{% highlight bash %}
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Set default version of ruby

{% highlight bash %}
echo "ruby-2.1.2" > ~/.ruby-version
{% endhighlight %}
